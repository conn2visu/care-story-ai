- Binary file storage with CDN delivery
- Automated backups and scaling

### Data Flow Architecture

```
User Interface → Authentication → API Gateway → Business Logic → Database
                     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
               JWT Tokens → Edge Functions → Supabase Client → PostgreSQL
                     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
               Route Guards → AI Processing → Real-time Sync → File Storage
```

### Integration Architecture

- **Frontend-Backend**: Supabase client with real-time subscriptions
- **AI Services**: Edge Functions proxy to OpenAI API
- **File Management**: Direct upload to Supabase Storage with policies
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with automatic token refresh
